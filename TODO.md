# TODO for Linking Logout Button in athleteview.jsx

- [x] Import AsyncStorage in athleteview.jsx to fix the missing import for logout functionality
- [x] Verify the logout navigation to index.jsx is correctly implemented (already present as router.push('/index'))
- [x] Test the logout button to ensure it navigates to index.jsx on click
